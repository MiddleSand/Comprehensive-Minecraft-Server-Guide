# Bukkit and the Spigot API
[Back to Dev Index](Dev_Index.md)

Bukkit and the Spigot API are two of the most well-known names in Minecraft server development, Bukkit of course being one of the first implementations of a plugin API with a Minecraft server and Spigot being a substantial improvement over Bukkit performance and API-wise.

Plugins built against the modern Spigot API are capapble of running on Spigot, Paper, Tuinity, Purpur, Airplane, Yatopia, and any of the dirivatives of any of these projects. However, some forks may cause issues with things, hence some plugins have different versions for Spigot verus Paper versus Tuinity, etc.

Basic information on how to use the Spigot API can be found [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-plugin-development/), and further significantly more detailed info can be found in [the javadoc.](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/)
